1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the div. The elements within this div have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

    <h1><em>NM2207 Final Project Assignment <br /></em><em>&quot;Catch Puggy the Pug&quot; Game </em><br />
    <em>Zhang Yinxingzi (A0116000J)</em></h1>
    <p><br />
    In this final project, I’ve created a simple game. I started coding this game with the codes I’ve done for the previous clicking game assignment. However, I improved it by adding different moving properties to the target object, and instead of the target object moving around in a continuous random movement, I made changes to it by making in move around in 6 specific positions. I will explain it further in my write up.
 <br> <br>
 I got my inspiration from the game called ‘whack a mole’.  In my game, there is a specific timeframe that has been set. The users will be “clicking” on the target object (the pug) to “hit” or in this case “catch” the pug that appears randomly from different parts of the screen, and the score displayed at the end will be the total amount of times that the user has clicked on the pug.
 <br><br>
I chose this because I could exercise most of the skills that we have learnt in our tutorial and lecture lessons in Week 6 (Games and Animation), Week 7 (Sounds), Week 9 (Arrays and Loops), Week 12 (Emitter). 
<br> <br>
 I made the background as a ballpit gif, as I thought that it was a really cute and it would be possible to use the emitter that we have learnt in Week 12 tutorial session. The emitter basically shoots out a dot (in this context, ball) regularly, and balls emitted are set to the same size of the balls on the gif to show consistency. Hence, this overall ballpit gif and emitter would give an effect that shows the movement of balls in a ball pit.
 <br> <br>
 I used the interval timer since I needed regular timings for the balls to be shoot out from the emitter, and it has to be consistent with the movement of balls in the background gif. <br> <br>
 I have also created a list of x and y-coordinates and an arrray to hold the coordinates, for the pug, by using what we learnt from Week 9.  Also, in the pool of ballpit, the pug is moving randomly across the 6 different positions that I’ve created. Mapping function is being used to create a random position for the pug. Hence, there is only 6 positions that the pug will move randomly across, just like the ‘whack a mole’ game.
 <br> <br>
 The game has 3 different difficulty levels, and the levels differ in the speed of movement of the pug. The levels range from easy, medium, to hard, where the easy level, the pug will be moving in a slower movement while the movements gets faster as we go to the next higher level. A radio button is used to indicate the choosing of the different levels. I did not want to use the ‘alert’ function (like what we used for the previous assignments) as I thought that it would be difficult for the user if they want to change a new level of game. If it is the alert for them to key in the level that they want at the start of the page, the user has to keep refreshing the page to get to a new level. Hence, I thought that the usage of the radio button will be better, as they can select which level that they want to play from the game screen itself. An alert will only be given if they click the start button when they have not chosen the difficulty level, and another form of alert is used to inform them about the level they have chosen.
 <br><br>
 Using what we have learnt in Week 7 (Sounds), I have added a joyful music tune to the game, as the setting is in a ballpit where there’s fun going on. And I thought it was appropriate to match every click on the pug to a dog barking sound because technically in the game we are “catching” the pug by clicking it. 
 <br> <br>
Everything is put onto the “SVG” page that we have been using in class, but I styled it with my own design, a pleasant light orange as the background colour, and gave it a simple font, to make it suit the aesthetic of the game, and appear aesthetically appealing to the users.</p>
